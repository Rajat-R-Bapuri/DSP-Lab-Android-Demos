# DSP Lab Android Demos

This is the repository for Android demos for the [EL-GY 6183 Digital Signal Processing Laboratory](http://bulletin.engineering.nyu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=9&coid=24134) taught by [Professor Ivan Selesnick](http://eeweb.poly.edu/iselesni/) at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

This tutorial intends to demonstrate that Android phones can be used as a tool to develop cool Digital signal processing applications.

## Android

`Kotlin` has been official language for mobile development on Android since 2017. `Kotlin` is designed to interoperate fully with `Java`. Programs in `Kotlin` are short as opposed to `Java` programs. You may choose to develop apps with `Kotlin` or `Java` depending on your interest.

You have following options:

1. You may start to learn `Kotlin` from the tutorial available in this [repo](./Kotlin/README.md) or from the [official documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/). After you have some experience with the `Kotlin` syntax, you can start with demo apps using `Kotlin` available [here](./Android_Demos/README.md).

2. If you do not have any programming experience with `Java` or if you want to refresh `Java` basics, then start [here](./Java_Demos/JavaBasics.md).
Otherwise, continue with Android Programming using `Java` from [here](./Android_Demos/README.md).

I have tried to write the same sample apps in both the languages.

(To understand this tutorial well, it is recommended to have some prior programming experience in other OOP languages such as C++ or Python or at least have some basic understanding of OOP concepts.)

## OpenCV

The OpenCV for Android tutorial is available [here.](./OpenCV/README.md) This tutorial includes setting up OpenCV for Android and few demos to get started with.
